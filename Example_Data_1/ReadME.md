# Example Data Set 1

Before running code, make sure to change the path in the Input Data Section (Starting on line 47)

Example:

path=os.chwd() + '/Example_Data_1/' (line 54)

Check to see that the following variables are correctly selected
* Set maps = 0 (Line 157)
* Set lorentz = 1 (Line 124)
* Set nt = 1 (Line 125)
* Set rbm = 1 (Line 109)

Leave the rest as the default data.
